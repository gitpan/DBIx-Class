=head1 NAME 

DBIx::Class - Extensible and flexible object <-> relational mapper.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a sql to oop mapper, inspired by the L<Class::DBI> framework, 
and meant to support compability with it, while restructuring the 
insides, and making it possible to support some new features like 
self-joins, distinct, group bys and more.

It's currently considered EXPERIMENTAL - bring this near a production
database at your own risk! The API is *not* fixed yet, although most of
the primitives should be good for the future and any API changes will be
posted to the mailing list before they're committed.

=head1 QUICKSTART

If you're using Class::DBI, replacing

  use base qw/Class::DBI/;

with

  use base qw/DBIx::Class/;
  __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/CDBICompat Core DB/);

will probably get you started.

If you're using AUTO_INCREMENT for your primary columns, you'll also want
yo load the approriate PK::Auto subclass - e.g.

  __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/CDBICompat PK::Auto::SQLite Core DB/);

(with is what ::Test::SQLite does to present the Class::DBI::Test::SQLite
interface)

If you fancy playing around with DBIx::Class from scratch, then read the docs
for DBIx::Class::Table, ::Row, ::Schema, ::DB and ::Relationship,

  use base qw/DBIx::Class/;
  __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/Core DB/);

and have a look at t/lib/DBICTest.pm for a brief example.
