=head2 Tracing SQL

The C<DBIX_CLASS_STORAGE_DBI_DEBUG> environment variable controls
SQL tracing, so to see what is happening try

  export DBIX_CLASS_STORAGE_DBI_DEBUG=1

Alternatively use the C<storage->debug> class method:-

  $class->storage->debug(1);

To send the output somewhere else set debugfh:-

  $class->storage->debugfh(IO::File->new('/tmp/trace.out', 'w');

Alternatively you can do this with the environment variable too:-

  export DBIX_CLASS_STORAGE_DBI_DEBUG="1=/tmp/trace.out"
