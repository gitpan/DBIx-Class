DBIx::Class::Manual::FAQ - Frequently asked questions

=head1 GENERAL

=head2 What is the point of this module?  Is it a fork of Class::DBI?

This is an alternative to L<Class::DBI>, intended to provide greater
functionality and simplicity.

It is inspired by the L<Class::DBI> framework, and provides a compat
layer to ease porting, but with a resultset-oriented, MI-based
design that makes extension easier and allows us to support more
complex relational operations like self-joins, C<DISTINCT>,
C<GROUP BY>s and more.

=head2 What databases does it support?

At least MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite and DB2.

=head2 What's the current status of this module?

This project is still at an early stage, so the maintainers don't make
any absolute promise that full backwards-compatibility will be
supported; however, if we can without compromising the improvements
we're trying to make, we will, and any non-compatible changes will
merit a full justification on the mailing list and a CPAN developer
release for people to test against.

=head2 Where can I go for support?

  Mailing list: http://lists.rawmode.org/mailman/listinfo/dbix-class/

  SVN: http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/repos/bast/trunk/DBIx-Class/

=head2 Inflating your date/time columns

You can use L<DBIx::Class::InflateColumn> to automatically create
L<DateTime> objects from your date/time columns. For more information,
see L<DBIx::Class::InflateColumn>.

=head1 POSTGRESQL-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS

=head2 Can't get last insert ID; inserts with serial primary keys fail

Older L<DBI> and L<DBD::Pg> versions do not handle C<last_insert_id>
correctly, causing code that uses auto-incrementing primary key
columns to fail with a message such as:

  Can't get last insert id at /.../DBIx/Class/Row.pm line 95

In particular the RHEL 4 and FC3 Linux distributions both ship with
combinations of L<DBI> and L<DBD::Pg> modules that do not work
correctly.

L<DBI> version 1.50 and L<DBD::Pg> 1.43 are known to work.
