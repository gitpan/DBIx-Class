=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere::Cursor - GUID Support for SQL Anywhere
over L<DBD::SQLAnywhere>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is for normalizing GUIDs retrieved from SQL Anywhere via
L<DBD::SQLAnywhere>.

You probably don't want to be here, see
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere> for information on the SQL Anywhere
driver.

Unfortunately when using L<DBD::SQLAnywhere>, GUIDs come back in binary, the
purpose of this class is to transform them to text.
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere> sets
L<cursor_class|DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/cursor_class> to this class by default.
It is overridable via your
L<connect_info|DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/connect_info>.

You can use L<DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached> safely with this class and not lose
the GUID normalizing functionality,
L<::Cursor::Cached|DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached> uses the underlying class data
for the inner cursor class.
