=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::MS_Jet::Cursor - GUID Support for MS Access over
ADO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is for normalizing GUIDs retrieved from Microsoft Access over ADO.

You probably don't want to be here, see
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ACCESS> for information on the Microsoft
Access driver.

Unfortunately when using L<DBD::ADO>, GUIDs come back wrapped in braces, the
purpose of this class is to remove them.
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::MS_Jet> sets
L<cursor_class|DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/cursor_class> to this class by default.
It is overridable via your
L<connect_info|DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/connect_info>.

You can use L<DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached> safely with this class and not lose
the GUID normalizing functionality,
L<::Cursor::Cached|DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached> uses the underlying class data
for the inner cursor class.
