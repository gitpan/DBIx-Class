=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::Microsoft_SQL_Server::Cursor - Remove trailing
NULLs in binary data and normalize GUIDs for MSSQL over ADO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is for removing trailing C<NULL>s from binary data and removing braces
from GUIDs retrieved from Microsoft SQL Server over ADO.

You probably don't want to be here, see
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::Microsoft_SQL_Server> for information on the
Microsoft SQL Server driver for ADO and L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::MSSQL> for
the Microsoft SQL Server driver base class.

Unfortunately when using L<DBD::ADO>, binary data comes back padded with
trailing C<NULL>s and GUIDs come back wrapped in braces, the purpose of this
class is to remove the C<NULL>s and braces.
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::Microsoft_SQL_Server> sets
L<cursor_class|DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/cursor_class> to this class by
default. It is overridable via your
L<connect_info|DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI/connect_info>.

You can use L<DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached> safely with this class and not lose
the binary data normalizing functionality,
L<::Cursor::Cached|DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached> uses the underlying class data
for the inner cursor class.
