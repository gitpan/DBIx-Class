=head1 NAME 

DBIx::Class::CDBICompat - Class::DBI Compatability layer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use base qw/DBIx::Class/;
  __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/CDBICompat Core DB/);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::Class features a fully featured compability layer with L<Class::DBI>
to ease transition for existing CDBI users. In fact, this class is just a
receipe containing all the features emulated. If you like, you can choose
which features to emulate by building your own class and loading it like 
this:

  __PACKAGE__->load_own_components(qw/CDBICompat/);

this will automatically load the features included in My::DB::CDBICompat, 
provided it looks something like this:

  package My::DB::CDBICompat;
  __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/
    CDBICompat::ColumnGroups
    CDBICompat::Retrieve
    CDBICompat::HasA
    CDBICompat::HasMany
    CDBICompat::MightHave
  /);
